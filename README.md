# PRODIGY_BWD_10-Task-3-new
Add user registration and login endpoints.  Store hashed passwords using a library like bcrypt.  On successful login, generate and return a JWT token to the client.  Protect certain routes to be accessible only by authenticated users using the JWT token.  Implement role-based access control to restrict access to specific endpoints.
